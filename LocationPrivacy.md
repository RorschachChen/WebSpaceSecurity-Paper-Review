# Title:

A Novel Location Privacy Protection Algorithm for Social Discovery Application

# Problem:

This paper concentrates on the protection of location privacy in social discovery application. 

---



First Introduce the location attack using probability theory then propose a new distance obfuscation method to defedn.

Attacks 2 types: side information-based methods(通过side判断), multi-attackers(三角定位).

The attackers in this paper are malicious users nearby. 

Author obfuscated the distance with a specific probability distribution determined by area destiny. 

The following content is referred from [1]:

Minimize the quality-of-service of social discovery applications, under the constraints that the privacy is higher than the privacy level. The privacy level is defined by users themselves.

# Attack Statement

Attack methods can be formalized with probability theory.

Return obfuscated distance *z*, true distance *x*. Attakers want to get the maximum a posteriori of the *x*, given the *z* with a prior.
