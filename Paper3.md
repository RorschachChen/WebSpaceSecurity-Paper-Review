# Title: Feature Extraction Optimization of JPEG Steganalysis Based on Residual Images

# Problem: 

Due to the use of different quality factors in the JPEG image, the features need to be scaled appropriately according to this quality factor to obtain better detection performance. A novel **adaptive scale adjustment** also for feature extraction filters.

Steganalysis:

​		2 categories: spatial domain-based and transform domain-based. 

​		2 steps: feature extraction and supervised learning.
