# Title: Semi-structured data protection scheme based on robust watermarking

**Keywords**: Copyright protection, Collusion attack, Semi-structured data, Watermarking



**Semi-structured data**: contains tags to separate semantic elements and allows hierarchies of records and fields within the data. XML, JSON...

Robustness and fidelity are two basic requirements for wateramarking. 



**JSON**: JSON有三种types，JSON Object, array, primitives. Objects和primitives都有键值对，array没有键。Object保存data以hierarchical方式，arrays以parallel，primitives以direct



# Proposed Method 

## Preprocessing

parse the JSON through traversal, then build a pairs *P*

只对value是数值的pair进行embed，避免semantic changes.

For a value in a pair, first exclude the leading zeros from the digit sequence. Then further exclude *b* leading digits to form the embeddable digit sequence. *b* equals upperfloor(log(T)) where T is the tolerance before and after embed. **容忍度越高，exclude的位数越多？**

**P.S. address_street整个是prefix，street和address是遍历到的key**

Then apply hash alg on the keys of x<sub>i</sub> to get a unique hash h<sub>i</sub>. 其中$\sigma$ is set as the private key K shared between the data hider and the recipient. 



Afterwards, a set of sequences S<sub>rand</sub> where S<sub>i</sub> is pseudorandomly generated by using hash as seed, and the elements in S<sub>i</sub> are within the range of [0, 1].

N: # of pairs. Ui: 标记有无修改，只看修改的. A: 修改量，|y-x|/x. Larger D indicates large distortion

### JSON file used

100, 200, 800, and 1500 pairs.

## Attack Simulation

Evaluate the ratios of successful extraction under different attacks.

### pair deletion, value modification, redundancy insertion

## Result

Robust. More valid pairs show stronger robustness.
